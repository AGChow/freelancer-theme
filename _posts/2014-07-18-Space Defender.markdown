description: A fast paced bullet hell shooter. This project was designed around using only the mouse and a single input with an emphasis on good feeling movement. The enemies and powerups were then built and tuned around the movement system. https://captainripley.itch.io/spacedefector

description2: A variety of enemy types and power ups were added to keep difficulty varying throughout. The enemy movement patterns and shooting patterns are also designed with random variation in mind so even two identical enemies move and shoot differently from one another.
