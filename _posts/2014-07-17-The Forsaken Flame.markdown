description: Developed with a group of four, this action puzzle game was designed around a single mechanic inspired by god of war. The player can throw and recall their flaming sword to fight and solve puzzles.

description2: Puzzles were designed around wrinkles within the main mechanic. For example, since the sword needed to be able to pass through objects to return to the player, a puzzle would require the player to understand how the sword interacts with the world to figure out the solution. This was used to both teach the player more about their magic sword, how it can be used to interact with the world, and give players that satisfying "Ah-ha!" moment.
